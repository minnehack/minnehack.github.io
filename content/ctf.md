# CTF

Andrew, the ACM UMN Webmaster, created a super cool MinneHack CTF badge that he wants to print out
and distribute to participants. He used OpenSCAD to design the badges and wrote an equally cool
online STL viewer to let the other ACM UMN officers admire his handiwork.

Since OpenSCAD files are version controllable, **he kept track of all his work with Git**.
